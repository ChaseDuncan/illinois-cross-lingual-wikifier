The GBK sold many units to Efficient Machinery Inc. in Vardinia.  Originally, GBK was unable to break into Vardinia's notoriously protective market channels, but with the help of Orwen McTavistock (the famous Mitch Vernon Co. chief executive) they did just that.
The Vardinian market was susceptible to McTavistock's sneaky manipulations. He acquired a small Vardinian company, the What Me Worry Corporation, and began penetrating supply chains from there.
