This is the story of how Efficient Machinery Inc., a US company unknown beyond the borders of Seattle, broke into in Vardinia's notoriously protective market channels with the help of Orwen McTavistock (the famous Mitch Vernon Co. chief executive).
In just three months, McTavistock acquired a small Vardinian company, the What Me Worry Corporation, in contravention of Vardinia's strict foreign investment laws. He used a shell company, GDK Investments Co., to cover the subterfuge.
